# AI-TextDetection
Assessing models for detection of AI generated text. 
In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly sophisticated, capable of generating text that is difficult to distinguish from human-written text. In this competition, we hope to foster open research and transparency on AI detection techniques applicable in the real world.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an essay was written by a student or an LLM.
